# PHPfox v4 Shoutbox App

This is a small app developed for developers to show how to connect a PHPfox community to a NodeJS app, which in this case uses
socket.io to create a shoutbox on a clients index page.

## Setup

On your PHPfox server. Run...
```
cd /PF.Site/Apps/
mkdir shoutbox
cd shoutbox
```
